				  	drink warm beer and eat boring food, including boiled
				  	vegetables.
				  	<p>Originally occupied by the Brttons, Romans, Angles,
		   	  	Saxons, and other barbarians.
		    	  	Later they were invaded by the Vikings and the Normans.
		    		Tired of being conquered, the English developed a very
		    		strong navy and set about conquering the rest of the
		    		world, calling their collection of colonies an "Empire".
		    		They have spent the last thousand years focused on the
		    		task of annoying the French, a role recently taken over
		    		by Donald Trump.
		  			<p>The English claim that they have not been invaded
		    		successfully for twelve hundred years, but the Pakistanis
		    		know better.</td>
